You may not sell or redistribute the icons themselves as icons.

You may not use the icons in a way that encourages downstream distribution. This means no templates or skins or theme kits or similar uses. (The person using the theme or template might not know where the icons came from and thus wouldn't be following the license.)

The icons may not be used in any form of "easy app builder" tools or websites.
